            <img src="images/img22.jpg" alt="Me" class="profile-image">
            <p>My friends call me Trina. I love to crochet and read. I like learning Korean and Mandarin when I'm watching asian Dramas.</p>
            <p>I am taking the Bachelor of IT course because technology is evolving everyday and while growing up, I have always been able to understand the concepts and new changes that come with technology every year. I wish I had taken this course right after high school. </p>
            <p>I am from the East Seoik and New Ireland Provinces of Papua New Guinea. </p>
            <p>I am 23 years old and will be turning 24 on the 30th of April.</p>
            <p>I am currently taking the Bachelor of Information Technology at Southern Cross University.</p>
            <p>I like Crocheting, Reading, watching Korean and Chinease Drama and Anime. Watching Korean and Chinease drama is fun to me because I like to listen to the language and pick up the some of the words to learn later.</p>
            <p>I have been studying the korean alphabet ever since and can now make out the individual sounds from the korean letters in a sentence. Not the words though.</p>
