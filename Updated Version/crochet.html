            <p>Here are some of the crochet work I have made. You can see more of my crochet work on my <a href="https://instagram.com/inmy_ownworld?igshid=ZDdkNTZiNTM=">Instagram</a> page.</p>
            <p>Crocheting is one of my favourite pass times and hobbies. I always like to try something new.</p>
            <p>Crocheting is simple and is a great stress reliever.</p>
            <p>I started crocheting around the age of 12 as something to do because I found it interesting at the time. As time went on, I got really good at it. I can finish a project within a day or a few hours depending on the type of the project and the amount of time I have.</p>

                <p>I made this small bag for my phone for carrying around the house. Later on, I gave it to one of my friends.</p>
